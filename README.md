## API Configuration

This project uses `json-server` as a mock API. The API base URL is:

```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3333/products';
```

Ensure the port or host is updated if you modify the `json-server` setup.

## Thought Process

### Design Considerations
1. **Component Structure**: Modular and reusable components for scalability.
2. **State Management**: React Context for simplicity and React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
3. **UI/UX Design**: Clean, intuitive, and responsive for seamless usage across devices.
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for critical components to ensure reliability.

### Trade-offs and Limitations
1. **API**: Relies on `json-server` for development. Integration with a real backend is needed for production.
2. **Scalability**: May need architectural changes for large catalogs.
3. **Authentication**: No user authentication implemented.
4. **Image Handling**: Currently supports only image URLs; no upload functionality.
5. **Performance**: Virtualization might be necessary for very large product lists.
